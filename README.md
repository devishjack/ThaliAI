# ThaliAI
 a personal AI assistant that uses OpenAI & ElevenLabs to create a personal assistant similar to ones only dreamed of in sc-fi movies and tv shows. The AI was named after the AI character in Logic's album The Incredible True Story.


 use cases as of 12/26/2023

 1. Talk to an AI with a realistic synthesized voice.
 2. have the AI create and run simple code for complex math equations, timers & probably a lot of other things (I honestly don't know the limit since it uses OpenAI's code interpreter).


roadmap:

1. add last.fm API usage
2. spotify, yt music & apple music API usage for player control
3. wikipedia API usage for gaining quick knowledge on any wikipedia pages (later on, I'll look into adding functionality for fandom.com as well)
4. quick front page news look up
